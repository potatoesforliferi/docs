The Gudtrip Invite Campaign allows users to earn additional Gudtrip Points by referring friends and building a network of active users. It's a win-win program where both you and your invitees benefit.

## How It Works

The referral system rewards you when people you invite use their Gudtrip vape devices. You earn bonus points based on your referral level and their usage.

<Info>
  Earn passive rewards from your network's consumption—the more active your referrals, the more you earn\!
</Info>

## Referral Structure

### Two-Level Reward System

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Level 1 (Direct Invites)" icon="user-plus">
    **10% bonus** on all points earned by people you directly invite
  </Card>
  <Card title="Level 2 (Indirect Invites)" icon="users">
    **5% bonus** on all points earned by people invited by your referrals
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  Build a deeper network for maximum passive earning potential. Your Level 1 referrals can invite others, giving you Level 2 bonus income.
</Tip>

## Campaign Rules

### How Bonuses Work

<Steps>
  <Step title="Direct Referral (Level 1)">
    When someone you directly invite earns Gudtrip Points by puffing their vape, you receive **10%** of their earned points as a bonus.
    
    **Example:** Your direct referral earns 1,000 points
    - They receive: 1,000 points
    - You receive: 100 bonus points (10%)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Indirect Referral (Level 2)">
    When someone invited by your referral earns points, you receive **5%** of their earned points as a Level 2 bonus.
    
    **Example:** Your indirect referral earns 1,000 points
    - They receive: 1,000 points
    - Their inviter receives: 100 bonus points (10%)
    - You receive: 50 bonus points (5%)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Complete Example

```

### Important Rules

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No Limit on Referrals" icon="infinity">
    You can invite unlimited users. There's no cap on how many people you can refer to Gudtrip.
    
    <Tip>

    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

    Reward depth is capped at **two levels**:
    - Level 1: Direct invites (10%)

    You don't earn from Level 3 and beyond.
  </Accordion>

## Maximizing Referral Earnings

### Strategies for Success

<Steps>
  <Step title="Quality Over Quantity">
    While you can invite unlimited users, focus on inviting people who will actively use their Gudtrip vapes. Active users generate more bonus points for you.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Encourage Pro Edition Adoption">
    If your referrals purchase the Special Edition (Pro) device, they can earn up to 120,000 points daily—meaning you could earn up to 12,000 bonus points daily from one active Level 1 referral.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Your Network">
    Encourage your Level 1 referrals to also invite friends. This creates a Level 2 network that generates additional passive income.
    
    <Check>
      A strong Level 2 network can provide substantial passive earnings.
    </Check>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stay Engaged">
    Active users are more likely to refer others. By being an engaged member of the community yourself, you set an example for your network.
  </Step>
</Steps>
