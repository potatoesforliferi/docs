Gudtrip Points are not just reward tokens; they represent a **scalable ecosystem asset** with multiple applications across the Gudtrip platform and partner networks.

## What are Gudtrip Points?

Gudtrip Points are the primary reward currency within the Gudtrip ecosystem. Users earn points by using their Gudtrip vape device, with rewards calculated based on puff duration and device type.

<Info>
  The longer you hold each puff, the more Gudtrip Points you earn. This incentivizes healthier, more mindful consumption patterns.
