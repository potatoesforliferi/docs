## Mission

Gudtrip aims to encourage cannabis consumers to switch from traditional joint smoking options to a much cleaner option of THC consumption using thoughtful vape alternatives. This active and healthy switch from combustion and burn consumption to a pure vaporization experience allows users to earn token rewards. Gudtrip rewards its users based on the duration of each puff; the longer one holds, the more one earns, a feature easily recorded by the Gudtrip vape.

## Key Differentiators

Gudtrip's niche feature makes it a trailblazing pioneer product in the market.
